# Use of AI

[i[Artificial Intelligence]<]

As of this writing in 2025, AI is the new hotness[^0D45]. Everyone is
using it, and no one can stop talking about it.

[^0D45]: Unlike the expression "new hotness", which is now tired.
    "Tired" is also tired, but that's self-referential so I think it has
    bottomed out.

The question no one seems to have an answer for is what's going to
happen. [flw[Sam Altman|Sam_Altman]] and others will tell you that AI is
any second now going to take over the world and solve everything and
humans will be rendered obsolete.

I like to think that will not happen, and that even if AI starts solving
everything, people will still want to use their ingenuity to push the
envelope farther than AI is able to.

What does all that mean for you as a computer science student (as of
this writing)?

Let's talk about how you should use an AI as a student and at work,
because those are two different things.

But before that, let's talk about what you're _not_ supposed to do.

## How *Not* to Use AI as a Student

[i[Artificial Intelligence-->Student non-usage]<]

I've mentioned elsewhere that I like to study the book [i[SICP]]
[flw[SICP|Structure_and_Interpretation_of_Computer_Programs]] to improve
my skills. And how I give myself a six-hour time limit to solve the
problems presented.

Now, these problems aren't real-world problems at all. They're contrived
training problems. And—get this—the answers are all freely available on
the Internet in a wide variety of places.

So why do I spend up to six hours? What a waste, right? Why not just
clone someone's repo and declare that it's implemented so I'm done?

Or, if not that, why not just copy what my friend made?

Or, if not that, why not hire someone to write the answers for me?

Of course, you know the answer. I don't do that because if I do, I
haven't learned anything. More specifically, _I haven't struggled with
the problems_ so the learning that would come from that is lost.

I think you see where this is going: just asking AI to solve the problem
isn't going to increase your skills at all. It's just asking someone
else to do the hard work.

It's like I went to the gym and asked my robot to lift the weights for
me. Sure, I can walk out saying the weights had been lifted
successfully, but I gained nothing from the experience.

I want you to name an activity that, aside from being at the gym,
involves lifting weights all day. Answer: there are none (generally
speaking for the majority of the population). Then why do we spend time
lifting dumbbells at the gym if there are zero other activities that
involve it?

The weights, of course, are just tools we use toward the greater goal of
being generally stronger.

*School is exactly like this*. The programming problems you get in
school are dumbbells. They're not real. They're designed to give you a
workout so that when you get to the job, you have the strength to do the
work.

And because the problems aren't real, AI can solve them all _really_
easily. There's tons of training material out there for them to learn
from.

*But don't be fooled*. Just because AI can solve your school problems
doesn't mean it can solve the real-world problems you're going to face
in your work. (As of now, it can't.)

(And if it could solve all those problems, how much do you think devs
would earn? There's a reason being a dev pays well, and it's because the
work is hard. If it was as easy as typing in an AI prompt, it would pay
minimum wage. That should clue you in to the fact that if *all* you can
do is prompt AI, you're not getting a high-paying gig.)

But that's not to say you shouldn't get good at using AI; it's just that
while you're a student, you have to use it the right way to maximize
your skills development.

The TLDR of this section is this: never ask AI to solve your entire
programming project. It probably can do that, but you'll learn nothing.
The goal of the project is not to complete the problem; it's to get a
workout while you complete it.

## How to Use AI as a Student

[i[Artificial Intelligence-->Student usage]<]

First things first: if your school or instructor has banned AI, that's
the rule. And you have to ignore what I've written here. Sorry. I'm
going to assume it hasn't done that foolish thing, and proceed.

So how should you use it? Use it like you're working with a decent tutor
who knows a lot of things kinda well. The AI tutor definitely makes
mistakes and gives poor advice from time to time, so you should cast a
critical eye on everything you learn from it.

When you're stuck on a small part of a project, ask about that. When you
can't remember syntax, ask about that. Ask about the idiomatic way to
write a loop that removes elements from the array it's iterating over.
Ask about what a particular operator does or how to use it. When you
have questions about the language or library, ask those. Little
bite-sized pieces are fine to ask it about. It can be way faster than a
standard Internet search.

Another place I've seen AI do a decent job is with hints. You can drop
in a functions-worth of code and tell the AI, "Something is wrong with
this [describe the issue]. But don't tell me the answer and don't give
me the corrected code. Just give me hints about how I need to think
about the problem to find the solution on my own."

And when you've completed the project (and it works completely), then
you can feel free to ask AI for a solution that you can use for
comparison. Or, better still, feed your solution into the AI and ask for
improvements.

Keep in mind that some of the "improvements" aren't going to be
improvements at all, and you'll want to ignore them. Cast that critical
eye. [Be opinionated](#be-opinionated) and have a rationale for which
advice you're accepting and which you're rejecting.

Lastly, there's another time it's fine to use AI to solve entire
projects: when your instructor says you can. This happens when they're
giving you more real-world practice as opposed to lifting weights. Both
are valuable uses of your study time.

## How to Use AI at Work

[i[Artificial Intelligence-->Work usage]<]

First, a caveat: the last time I was working in production (and I did so
for 20 years), AI as we know it today did not exist. That said, I do use
it to get things done more quickly today. So that's my level of
"expertise".

I'd mentioned earlier that new devs solve problems with logical
reasoning, but [i[Experts]] experts, in addition, recognize patterns. As
a more-experienced dev, you have a better understanding of which
building blocks make up a problem. You recognize the pieces that you
need, and you logically reason about how to assemble them.

In other words, experienced devs are better at _Understand_ and _Plan_.
(They're better at all phases, but recall that _Understand_ and _Plan_
is where the battle is.)

As such, they can leverage AI to help them write the code for those
building blocks. They can say things like, "I need to filter those
results for anything that matches this regular expression"—and then they
ask an AI to code up that building block, they expertly verify that the
code is correct and modify it to suit their needs, and then move on.

Even with technologies they aren't familiar with, this can help them get
the job done. But they still need to rely on their expertise to know
when they need to learn more. That is, experienced devs have a nose for
dangerous code and know when they need to proceed carefully and gather
more knowledge.

In this regard, AI can be really useful for doing proof-of-concept work
and rapid prototyping where the code is often throwaway.

Again, as a student, you can't bring that experience (that you haven't
yet acquired) to bear, and if you just try to use AI like a [i[Experts]]
seasoned dev, you're going to have buggy, fragile code that you don't
know how to fix. And worst of all, you won't be developing the skills
you need.

But as you gather more experience, you can definitely rely on AI to
write a large amount of boilerplate code for you that you already know
the logic behind, anyway.

## AI and the Jobs Market

[i[Artificial Intelligence-->Job market effects]<]

When you read this, I want you to know that I, the author, thought
[fl[Yahoo!|https://www.yahoo.com/]] was a dumb idea when it first
launched. I kinda still do think it was, but it made a bazillion dollars
since then, so I was wrong. At least capitalistically.

One thing old devs have been hearing their entire careers is that we're
on the verge of the "no code" revolution, and that this tool or that
tool will finally put coders out of a job because everyone everywhere
will be able to produce software.

Every one of these predictions has something in common in that they were
all fantastically wrong.

But things are only wrong until they aren't, and LLMs like ChatGPT are
definitely novel beasts that don't play by the previous rules.

>
> That's not to say they won't realize those gains; but it is to say it
> smells familiar.

And LLMs are showing incredible coding expertise. I am perpetually
amazed by what they can do. But can they do it all?

I have a thought experiment for you. Let's say there's an AI so good
that I can tell it, "AI, design and implement a corporation that will
crush all my competitors and make me the richest person on Earth," and
it will actually successfully do it.

But the catch is that everyone has access to the same AI and they can
all make the same request. Where does that land us? We're back to square
one where we're on equal footing.

As a capitalist, though, I don't like equal footing. I want to get an
edge on my competition. So I start thinking, "What can we do that's
slightly different than what the AI is telling my competitors?"

And just like that, humans are back in the game!

I think that trend's going to continue, maybe forever.

What will happen, I predict, is that the easy boilerplate jobs that
exist now will experience a massive tightening. AI can solve lots of
those easy problems, and you don't need a big team of engineers behind
them. The more novel problems will still need a lot of human work.

But maybe not as much work as before. AI can help in a variety of ways,
outlined above, so it helps speed things up.

Going back in time, consider when most programs were written in
[flw[assembly language|Assembly_language]] and it took a lot of
specialized knowledge to get these error-prone programs written. And
then compilers became popular and now no one[^F913] writes in assembly
any longer; those jobs are toast, destroyed by the faster, easier coding
that compilers afford.

[^F913]: Well, a few people do. You should try it for fun. It's something
    else.

In short, I think we're going to keep pushing it, and AI will become a
very useful tool, but only with humans at the helm. I think. We shall
see.
