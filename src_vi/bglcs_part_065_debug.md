# Debugging

[i[Debugging]<]

Before we begin, the best way to debug a program is to not have bugs to
begin with. Though we're only human and we'll certainly <!-- the
following two words are deliberately misspelled --> mak mstakes, <!--
sic --> the best way to avoid bugs is to adhere to the problem solving
framework. Remember that the programming battle is in the _Understand_
and _Plan_ phases. The more completely and correctly you complete those
phases, the fewer bugs you'll have when coding it up.

That said, let's talk about what to do when the inevitable happens.

## Mental Model

[i[Mental model of computation]<]

This is one of the most important things about being a developer: *have
a mental model of computation*.

That is, you should be able to read code and know what's going to
happen.

``` {.python}
def foo(n):
    i = 0

    while i < n:
        i = i + 1 + (i % 2)

    print(i)

foo(5)
```

Read the nonsense Python code, above. Mentally compute the output. Then
see if you're right. (I wrote the code, and it still took me a solid
minute to mentally model the answer. But I was right!)

***If you cannot "run" the code in your head, you cannot debug.*** Yes,
I'm going that strong. I'm sure some people disagree with me, but I want
to drive home how important this is.

*Debugging is the art of finding the part of the code where your mental
model of the computation and the reality of the computation diverge.*
And then fixing it.

If you don't have a mental model, you don't have anything to compare
against and you'll make little progress.

How do your improve your mental model of computation?

* **Study code**. Trace through it. There's a ton of code out there to
  practice with, e.g. on GitHub, on HackerRank, your peers' codebases,
  your own stuff that you wrote four months ago and have forgotten how
  it works, etc.

* **Predict the output**. As you learn the code, try to predict how it
  will behave when run.

* **Manually trace a run**. Use a whiteboard to manually track what values
  variables take on, what functions get called, and what line of code is
  executing.

* **Write a specification**. Study some code and "reverse engineer" it.
  Figure out what it does, then write a human-readable spec that
  perfectly describes the algorithm or codebase to the degree that a
  reader could reimplement it from scratch.

* **Single-step through with a debugger**. Have the computer show you
  how the program is flowing. We'll talk more about that, below.

You'll definitely improve this skill with practice.

## Reproducing the Bug

[i[Debugging-->Reproducing bugs]<]

First things first: see if you can get the bug to happen consistently.
Being able reproduce ("repro") the bug is the first step in being able
to squash it.

Sometimes this is actually the hard part. You saw something go wrong
once (or someone reported they saw it), and now you can't repro it.

If you can't repro it, you'd just be shooting in the dark trying to fix
it. Your goal at this point is to just get it to happen at all. Work
backward logically. What _must_ have happened in the program flow in
order to see what the bug reporter saw? Look there first. Even if you're
sure some condition _can't possibly_ be true, if it must have been true
to see the bug, then it _must_ have been true! Keep tracking back,
looking for where your mental model and the code diverge and use that to
repro it yourself.

If you can only sporadically repro it, you have a chance, but it's going
to be hard work. Your goal is to get it to repro consistently. This
saves you spending forever trying to get a rare repro. If you could make
it happen consistently, that's a big time saver, and it helps you narrow
down where the bug can be.

Once you find how to repro it consistently, now you can get even more
systematic about things. You want to find the minimum number of steps
that can cause the bug to manifest. For example, you're playing a game
and you find a bug when you complete 20 laps around the race course and
then drive into a tree. Maybe try just driving into the tree first. If
you're lucky, you saved yourself 20 laps and narrowed the bug down to
the tree. If nothing happens, you know that the 20 laps is an integral
part of the bug. Maybe try a single lap followed by the tree. Does that
repro?

Getting the minimum number of steps not only helps you narrow down even
further where the bug is in the code, but it makes it easier to test
fixes because you don't have to spend so long reproing the issue.

## Finding the Bug

[i[Debugging-->Locating bugs]<]

There is a bug somewhere. You know that because when you give your code
some input, and it cranks away at it, eventually it gives you unexpected
output.

Somewhere in that big process the reality of the computation diverges
from your mental model of the computation.

At first, all you might know is that somewhere in 10,000 lines of code
something went wrong. So you've narrowed it down to that. Your mental
model said that if the input was `2`, the output would be `3490`. And
instead the output was `299792458`.

Therefore you know the bug is somewhere between the input and the
output.

You _could_ just start changing random things in the code to see if it
gets fixed. This is sometimes called _shotgun debugging_ or _prayer
debugging_, and it very, very, very, very, *very* rarely works. Way more
often you'll just mess things up and make the problem even harder to
find. It's like trying to fix your car's electrical issues by randomly
adding and cutting wires. It's not even worth debugging this way.

And yet despite that, it's a very common technique practiced, in vain,
by students worldwide. You, however, should not use it.

Instead, it's time to be systematic. Somewhere in that pipeline of
computation the intermediate computed values diverge from your mental
model. Your job is to find out where.

So you start probing _inside_ the program at various points to see
where things go off the rails. Binary search is great—jump to the middle
of the process and examine the values during a run (see below). If they
are as expected, the bug must therefore be between the middle of the
program and the end! You've just halved your search space. Now do it
again until you narrow it down far enough to see the bug.

I would contend, though some might disagree, *the bug is not found until
you understand it*. That is, you **must** understand exactly how your
program was giving the output `299792458` instead of the expected
`3490`. Gaining that full understanding has a number of benefits:

* You can be more confident you've fixed the bug for-realsies.
* You will learn to recognize the patterns that led to this bug,
  allowing you to better avoid it in the future.
* You're working out your problem-solving skills while you do this.

Once you understand how the wrong output was produced, then decisively
and correctly fix the issue, and know why the fix will work.

Finally, if you're just filing a bug report (i.e. someone else will fix
it), being able to give them the minimum steps needed to repro will make
you their hero for the day. Consider it from the reverse perspective;
would you rather fix a bug with a vague, long sequence of steps to
repro, or one with a few steps that caused it to repro every time? The
more specific things are, the happier the bug-fixer is, whether that's
you or someone else.

## Print Debugging

[i[Debugging-->By printing]<]

The good old-fashioned standard way of probing software in the middle of
a run is called _print debugging_, or, if you're a C programmer, _printf
debugging_ (pronounced "print eff").

This is basically just tactically placing print statements inside your
code to see what state your program is in.

There are a couple common uses of this:

* Print anything at all to see if some part of the code actually
  executes.

  ``` {.python}
  print("A")

  x = foo()

  print("B")

  if x == 3:
      print("C")
      x *= 2
  else:
      print("D")
      bar()

  print("E")
  ```

  Notice that when I run the code, I can see how far it gets before a
  crash, and I can determine if `x` were `3` or not.

* Print some specific values to see what they are.

  Here's an example where we're getting data from some sensor in a loop
  for processing. We suspect that some of the data is wonky (maybe the
  sensor is busted) so we're printing it out to see what we get.

  ``` {.python}
  while not done:
      data = get_sensor_data()

      print(f"Got sensor data: {data}")

      process_sensor_data(data)

      done = data < 0
  ```

Now, print debugging is kinda frowned upon as a lesser means of
debugging compared to using a real debugger (as in the following
section). But everyone does it at some point or another, and some
people even swear by it.

The place that I think it really shines is when you need to gather a lot
of data about the run to see a larger pattern emerge, or when you need
to catch an infrequent event. If something happens one run in 10,000,
single stepping through with a standard debugger is going to take
forever. You can add some print statements and script a run 10,000 times
and watch the output to see when it manifests.

One thing to watch out for is that if you're printing a lot, it can be
tough to visually parse the output, and error messages might be lost in
it. I'd recommend redirecting the output to a file and then bringing it
up in an editor to search.

And, finally, don't forget to remove all your print statements before
you ship your work!

## Debuggers

[i[Debuggers]<]

Debuggers are tools that help you find bugs. There are many different
debuggers, but virtually all of them share a common set of features. The
main features are:

* Add _breakpoints_ where the program will stop running and you'll get
  control in the debugger
* "Single step" through a program a line at a time
* Examine the values of variables

Additional features that are common are:

* Stepping into a function
* Continuing out of a function
* Stepping over a function
* Setting the values of variables
* Examining the call stack
* Setting breakpoints that trigger conditionally

Rarer are _time-travel debuggers_. In addition to allowing you to step
forward through your program, they allow you to step backward, as well!
This is great if you step past the bug by accident and want to step back
to see it.

All major [flw[IDEs|Integrated_development_environment]] have debugger
functionality. (It's part of what's "integrated", the "I" in "IDE".)
There are also standalone debuggers that you can run. And all mainstream
languages have some kind of debugger support.

As you might imagine, with those features, debuggers are really
powerful.

If you suspect a bug in function `foo()`, you can set a breakpoint
there, run the code, and then get control of the debugger when `foo()`
executes. Then you can step through it a line at a time, looking at how
the values of variables change. And there's no need to add any print
statements.

Note that in VS Code, getting your debugger set up might be trivial, or
you might have to edit some esoteric JSON files to get it going.

In any case, learning to use a debugger is a valuable skill that can
save you massive amounts of time while you're trying to track down that
pesky gremlin in your code.
