Are you getting into Computer Science, or thinking about it? Are you
considering a degree? Or maybe you're in it already. This
super-high-level guide is for you!

I'm not going to talk about how to write code (much). And I'm not really
going to talk about the science and math behind Computer Science,
ironically. What I'm going to talk about in these roughly 40 pages is
more about _how to learn_ when you're a nascent software developer.

Now, as much as I'd like to know exactly the way that everyone learns
(and manage to wedge that into 40 pages), I, to be perfectly honest,
don't.

What I do have is 40+ years of programming experience (self-taught
before college), 20 years of industry experience, and 8+ years of
teaching experience. And a BS and MS in Computer Science.

And I have opinions about how to best way to learn how to program!

Now, let's get this right out of the way: you might completely disagree
with what I have to say here. And I'm okay with that.

But I have had the opportunity to see students make a wide variety of
mistakes. And hopefully I can head some of these off at the pass for a
number of readers.

Students and teachers, alike: if you find something you disagree with or
something vital that is missing, please don't hesitate to [fl[let me
know|mailto:beej@beej.us]] so I can improve the guide.

Disclaimer: like with all the guides I write, I'm not the master of the
subject. And with a squishy topic like how humans learn, I'm even less
so.

But give it a read and take what's useful and leave the rest for the
[flw[boids|Boids]].

## Audience

[i[Audience]]

Undergrad students just getting into programming are the people I had in
mind while writing this. So give-or-take a bit around that target
audience. People in high school or just looking to learn how to program
are also probably out there in the audience, as well.

### On the term "Computer Science"

This guide is, to a degree, poorly named. It's not really about what
most people consider to be "computer science". It's more about
programming, which is a thing computer scientists, software engineers,
developers, and programmers do a lot of.

I've named it a _Guide to Computer Science_ for a couple reasons:

* At least in the US, the degree program software developers get into is
  called "Computer Science" and people starting in that degree program
  are the target audience.
* When you're beginning to study Computer Science (the degree), you'll
  be doing the stuff in this guide. Later, when you get to the Computer
  Science (the science) part of the degree, you'll have already outgrown
  it.

So the Guide is good for getting started (hopefully), but do understand
that you're just dipping your toes into a vast ocean, waiting to be
explored.

## Corrections

[i[Corrections to the Guide]]

I make these guides available for free in the sincere hope that people
will find them maximally useful. If there's something that's not
maximally useful (or, you know, "wrong"), I'd love to hear about it so I
can fix it in furtherance of my mission.

## Email Policy

[i[Emailing Beej]]

I'm generally available to help out with email questions so feel free to
write in, but I can't guarantee a response. I lead a pretty busy life
and there are times when I just can't answer a question you have. When
that's the case, I usually just delete the message. It's nothing
personal; I just won't ever have the time to give the detailed answer
you require.

As a rule, the more complex the question, the less likely I am to
respond. If you can narrow down your question before mailing it and be
sure to include any pertinent information (like platform, compiler,
error messages you're getting, and anything else you think might help me
troubleshoot), you're much more likely to get a response.

If you don't get a response, hack on it some more, try to find the
answer, and if it's still elusive, then write me again with the
information you've found and hopefully it will be enough for me to help
out.

Now that I've badgered you about how to write and not write me, I'd just
like to let you know that I _fully_ appreciate all the praise the guide
has received over the years. It's a real morale boost, and it gladdens
me to hear that it is being used for good! `:-)` Thank you!

## Dedication

The hardest things about writing these guides are:

* Learning the material in enough detail to be able to explain it
* Figuring out the best way to explain it clearly, a seemingly-endless
  iterative process
* Putting myself out there as a so-called _authority_, when really
  I'm just a regular human trying to make sense of it all, just like
  everyone else
* Keeping at it when so many other things draw my attention

A lot of people have helped me through this process, and I want to
acknowledge those who have made this book possible.

* Everyone on the Internet who decided to help share their knowledge in
  one form or another. The free sharing of instructive information is
  what makes the Internet the great place that it is.
* Everyone who submitted corrections and pull-requests on everything
  from misleading instructions to typos.

Thank you! ♥
